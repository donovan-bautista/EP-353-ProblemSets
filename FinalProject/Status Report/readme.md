#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a (seemingly) functional block of code that adds a tremolo effect to audio that passes through. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not gotten the audio to work properly in the AudioPluginHost. This could be because the plugin editor is not complete 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I'm having issues getting values from the processor into the editor. It's saying that a lot of things are undeclared.
