# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of this project will be "Rapid: A Live Tremolo Audio Processor"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a wavetable synthesizer.")

My project will be an audio processor. It will add a tremolo to any audio that passes through the software. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

At its core, the goal of this project will be to create a live audio processor that gives a tremolo effect to any audio that passes through. This processor will be made in JUCE (and by that extent C++), utilizing JUCE's audiopluginhost. In the audiopluginhost, the user will play live audio which will be manipulated through said plugin. The idea behind this project comes from Akito's input and resources provided in class. A simple timeline will be studying said resources to see how they work, recreating them for a better understanding, and finally building a new processor with the aforementioned tremolo effect. 

## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's project, which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

n/a

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And it is not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A live audio processor that adds a tremolo effect to any audio that passes through 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to the prior sentence, the plugin will come with parameters that can affect aspects such as wet/dry and tremolo speed

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The plugin comes with everything mentioned above, but includes a professional ui and the ability to save your own presets.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

First, I will have to immerse myself in how live audio is processed in JUCE/C++. This will challenge me to learn about unfamiliar and/ or shaky topics, such as storing audio, adding  processing effect, and output. I will also have to research how a tremolo effect could be added. Some examples of resources I could use are prior problem sets, and the SineWavePlayer in the example from week 10 (Ideas recommended by Akito).  When I am successfully able to create a tremolo effect, I will then experiment with different sounds and scenarios to see what applications this could have in the real world. Some examples of this would be playing my flute or saxophone and analyzing the result.
